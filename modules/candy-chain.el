  "Candy Chain is a pretty colourful theme, on charcoal black bg.

The theme is supposed to be colourful, yet subtle. As in, it should
highlight what really matters to you, and make distingishing those
elements fairly easy, while making other things pretty as well, but
toning down them because they're just not as important."
